# A Whole New World 

- Intro to reading through online platforms, talked about HOW we read online and the difference between reading online and on paper (twitter = short statements). 
- An intro to minecraft: not being an avid player of minecraft, I was sceptical of what we'd be learning through the game, but as I followed along through Flinders St Station whilst Andy and Karen were talking, I felt like i was a protagonist to some sort of film or book. It was interesting how immersive this sensation felt, and opened my eyes to how narratives are created through virtual games.

- With Karens help, we began our tutorial on processing and how code functions through this format of p5js - changing colours using the mousex/mousey functions, how to create shapes, and some concrete information on the basic fundementals of code. This being my first time utilising processing and code in a design format, I realised how interactive your artworks and designs can be as a user just by the simple click of a mouse.
