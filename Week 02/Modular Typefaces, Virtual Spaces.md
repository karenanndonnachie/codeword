Its design is one with the circular shape of the nails and the composite dynamics of the promenade 


this week I also began setting a goal to watch some coding tutorials: this is an entirely new realm to me, and I figured doing some self-exploration would be of help. I started watching the coding train tutorials on youtube, here's some notes i've written attached. 

We discussed our first assignment, reading House of Leaves through a game and split into our groups (ours choosing animal crossing).

We shared our first processing works (mine being extremely rudimental), but I learnt some fundimentals that helped me solifiy my understanding in the basics of code on processing.
