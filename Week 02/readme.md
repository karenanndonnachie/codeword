this week I also began setting a goal to watch some coding tutorials: this is an entirely new realm to me, and I figured doing some self-exploration would be of help. I started watching the coding train tutorials on youtube, here's some notes i've written (you can find all of them in my 'coding notes' file). 

We discussed our first assignment, reading House of Leaves through a game and split into our groups (ours choosing animal crossing).

Karens processing tutorial brought us deeper into the worlds of p5js, [here's what we did](https://renpapers.github.io/codeword/Processing%20Sketches/karens__O____week_2)

- discuss house of leaves and what you found interesting
