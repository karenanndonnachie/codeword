Intro to electronic literature, and some examples such as AI Dungeon: a generative text software where the entire class created a comedic horror story of some sort. The future of design practices and technology was definitely eye opening during this class, as I discovered these case studies and examples to be so otherworldly to the usual narrative we see on paper. It was interesting to see how immersive and real a virtual environment can be, when I used to think the only way this effect could be created was with the physicality of a book. 

Our group work for AT1 was continued, as our group scripted and read our chapter and assigned roles and tried to connect online in game (had a few connection issues, but all in all was a success!)
