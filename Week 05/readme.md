- Presenting our groups final project
- Worked on ratoinale WIIP 
- Next assignment and the readings: trouble with choosing mine: I realise I like to do the analysis' of text and theories, rather than someone else doing them which is why i had trouble choosing a text for our next assignment. Fortunately Andy allowed me to further self explore a piece of my own, and I decided to find myself an analysis on Haruki Murakami's writings - one of my favourite authors. 

Group text discussion:
The text discusses the definition of space, and how it’s been defined in multiple stances and contexts.

Questioning the boundaries of space, and the unlimitless ephemerality in instances such as utopia’s - and how we relate this to physical spaces that are akin (heterotopia’s). Inbetween the two lies a ‘mirror’. 

Perception of space and it’s absence, using the analogy of mirror caused us to further contemplate the reality of this physical world we live in. Questioning if the mirror is portraying real life. 

Public space, private space, social space, family space
