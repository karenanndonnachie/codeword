- discussed details, pseudocode of our ideas

These realities will be concepts the text discusses, examples (aka. parts of Murakami's writing that show these concepts), and specific quotes that I found profound and insightful. I'm unsure at this point whether these will all be split into their own individual reality (as that would be a whoollle lot of code that I'm not sure I have the timeline for), or combined into their own concept.
