# WIP - START TRIALLING

## Resources/references I used:

- 'stars' moving in background to add noise and texture, not interactive. I tried to create my own version of this based off of the original code, as well as tried to understand/grasp the concept before using it. 
I wonder why the 'sparkle' variable didn't have to be written before the 'setup' function (ask Karen next class). Other than that, I understood how this mainly used the randomised function. Although I'd also like these to move at a slower pace (1 day later update: after doing some research I realised the 'frameRate' function would fix this). I also can't use an alpha on this and am unsure why (wanted it to seem more translucent, less block-y)

Another resource I learnt about the randomised function was a week or so ago, from the Coding Train tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmV2kuQKwA&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain

Learning about shaders to create a 'glow' effect on my stars!: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/shader and https://p5js.org/examples/3d-basic-shader.html
