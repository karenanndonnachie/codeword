# A Whole New World 

- Intro to reading through online platforms, talked about HOW we read online and the difference between reading online and on paper (twitter = short statements). 
- An intro to minecraft: not being an avid player of minecraft, I was sceptical of what we'd be learning through the game, but as I followed along through Flinders St Station whilst Andy and Karen were talking, I felt like i was a protagonist to some sort of film or book. It was interesting how immersive this sensation felt, and opened my eyes to how narratives are created through virtual games.
